# Hospital Readmission Risk Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes 30-day hospital readmissions using SQL and Python to identify key clinical and operational risk drivers.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – Hospital Readmission Prediction
- Size: 30,000 patient records
- Target variable: 30-day readmission

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL Server
- Power BI (dashboarding)

## Key Findings
- Overall readmission rate: **12.25%**
- Length of stay is not a strong predictor of readmission
- Discharge destination is the primary risk driver
  - Rehab: 17.5%
  - Nursing Facility: 16.85%
  - Home: 10.04%

## Visual Outputs
All exploratory analysis visuals are saved in the `outputs/` folder:
- Readmission distribution
- Readmission rate by discharge destination
- Readmission rate by diabetes status

## Next Steps
- Build executive dashboards in Power BI
- Add predictive modeling for readmission risk
